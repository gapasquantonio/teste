# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

 In the refactored version of deterministicPartitionKey, I made the following changes:



- Removed the unnecessary `let declaration for candidate` since it can be declared with const and reassigned later. Also,by using the ternary operator notation, It makes the code looks shortens and more concise.
- Removed the redundant JSON.stringify call if the candidate is already a string.
- Reduced nesting whenever possible by using early returns. 
- Combined the two cases where we assigned a value for candidate into a single statement. If that resolution, we avoid code duplication and further simplify the logic.
- Instead of checking that candidate exists using `if (candidate)` before checking its type, we simply check its type. This saves us a line of code.
